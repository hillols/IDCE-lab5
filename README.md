## IDCE-lab5

- This code gives a dictionary of coutnry name and number of refugees population as key-value pairs. 
- It also extracts keys and values of the dictionary. 
- A statement is there to cojoin name of countries with refugee population.

#Errors: I have encountered errors while using for loop in the last statement. I wanted to join keys and values with + sign as I do for strings, but that did not work. I had to check online for solution. I looked that up and found that in geekforgeeks.org.

#Debugging: I have changed the '+' with ',' which resolved the issue.
